	<p><strong>Getting Started</strong>
		<br>
		Map the Money Maze is scheduled to launch in late 2016. Grant makers want to know there is interest in our program. You can help us document that interest, obtain funding and launch on time by:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Registering your information to be among the first to be notified when Map the Money Maze is ready</li>
		<li>Answering a few brief questions</li>
		<li>Referring us to people and/or organizations that can benefit from Map the Money Maze.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Funding</strong>
		<br>
		Launching Map the Money Maze on-time depends primarily on raising enough donor funding. Please donate what you can and your name will be acknowledged on our website as a member of the Founders Circle.

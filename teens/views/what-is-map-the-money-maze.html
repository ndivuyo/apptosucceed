	<h5>MAP THE MONEY MAZE IS VARIED, TO KEEP THE EXPERIENCE FRESH FROM BEGINNING TO END. HEREâ€™S JUST ONE EXAMPLE TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA:</h5>
	<ul>
		<li><span style="">Through this website you enter a network of mazes.</span> Once inside, you find some information. You go over the information until you understand the concept.</li>
		<li><span style="">When you are ready, you move</span> a bit further in the Maze and you are challenged to make a decision on a real-world financial situation, using what you just learned.</li>
		<li><span style="">If you make a good decision,</span> you move on in the Maze. If you make a poor choice, you are routed to a place for additional information to prepare you for a similar challenge until you make the right decision for you.</li>
		<li><span style="">No one has the same path</span> through the Maze. In many cases, what is best for you, is not for someone else.</li>
		<li><span style="">You are in complete control</span> of your progress through the Maze. The farther you go, the more value is added to your financial future.</li>

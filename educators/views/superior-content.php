		</div>
		<div>
			<h5>Accommodates Learning Differences</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Every student is different and has his/her own learning preferences.</li>
				<li>
					With Map the Money Maze, students control how they learn, so they:
					<ul>
						<li>Are more apt to be engaged in learning when they can control their learning preferences.</li>
						<li>Learn from the program when they are most motivated.</li>
						<li>Learn more efficiently and effectively.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<ul>
			<li>Map the Money Maze students can choose to log on:
				<ul>
					<li>
						When? Anytime!
						<ul>
							<li>Log on 24/7, year-round</li>
							<li>Teens choose the time that works best for them; for example: times of the day they learn best, times without distractions like hunger/thirst, fatigue, and time constraints. </li>
							<li>Summer-term subscriptions offer advantages: Map the Money Maze can help students without summer learning experiences maintain their academic skills. (Students without summer learning start the fall term at an academic disadvantage. Many are moved to a lower learning level when they actually have the ability to do the higher-level work.)</li>
							
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Where? Anywhere with internet access! From a computer or mobile device, students can:
						<ul>
							<li>Access Map the Money Maze anywhere there is internet access.</li>
							<li>Choose a place that is optimal for their learning style; for some it may be a secluded, small, library cubicle, and for others it may be a busy cafe with lots of activity and background noise.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Speed? Any speed!
						<ul>
							<li>Teens can progress through the program as quickly or as slowly as they like.</li>
							<li>They can return to a previous section of the program to review or make changes, skip a section that they are already competent in or choose to access additional information.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						How Long? As long as they want to.
						<ul>
							<li>Teens may explore the program for as long as they like.</li>
							<li>Map the Money Maze cannot be completed in one session. Students are encouraged to stop their session when they begin to lose focus.</li>
							<li>All of the content is important so to optimize comprehension and retention when logged on, the student should be alert and immersed in the program.</li>
						</ul>

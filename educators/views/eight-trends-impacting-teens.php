					Continuing education after high school is no longer an option. Teens who do not earn a four-year college degree or, at least, a certification will be stuck in minimum-wage jobs and a life of poverty.

							<li>Chances of employment and earning potential are drastically reduced.</li>
							<li>The cycle of poverty, economic crisis and its social and psychological fallout perpetuates.</li>
							<li>As a result, trillions of dollars drain from the nation’s economy in services and lost opportunity. When this demographic group has babies and as available jobs increasingly require higher education and training, the burden on the national economy grows exponentially.</li>
